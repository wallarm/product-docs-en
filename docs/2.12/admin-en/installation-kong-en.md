## Installation

!!! warning "Installation of postanalytics on a separate server"
    If you are planning to install postanalytics on a separate server, you must install postanalytics first. 
    
    See details in [Separate postanalytics installation][doc-postanalytics].

To install the Wallarm module with Kong, you need to:

1. Add Wallarm repositories.
2. Install Wallarm packages.
3. Configure postanalytics.
4. Set up the filter node for using a proxy server.
5. Connect the filter node to the Wallarm cloud.
6. Configure the postanalytics server addresses.
7. Configure the filtration mode.
8. Configure logging.

!!! info "If Wallarm WAF is already installed in your environment"
    If you install Wallarm WAF instead of already existing Wallarm WAF or need to duplicate the installation in the same environment, please keep the same WAF version as currently used or update the version of all installations to the latest. For the postanalytics installed separately, versions of substite or duplicate installations must be the same as already installed postanalytics too.

    To check the installed version if WAF node and postanalytics are installed on the same server:

    === "Debian"
        ```bash
        apt list wallarm-node
        ```
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        apt list wallarm-node
        ```
    === "CentOS"
        ```bash
        yum list wallarm-node
        ```

    To check the versions of WAF node and postanalytics installed on different servers:

    === "Debian"
        ```bash
        # run from the server with installed WAF node
        apt list wallarm-node-nginx
        # run from the server with installed postanalytics
        apt list wallarm-node-tarantool
        ```
    === "Ubuntu"
        ```bash
        # run from the server with installed WAF node
        apt list wallarm-node-nginx
        # run from the server with installed postanalytics
        apt list wallarm-node-tarantool
        ```
    === "CentOS"
        ```bash
        # run from the server with installed WAF node
        yum list wallarm-node-nginx
        # run from the server with installed postanalytics
        yum list wallarm-node-tarantool
        ```

    * If the version `2.16.x` is installed, follow the instructions for [WAF node 2.16](../../../admin-en/installation-kong-en/) and for [separate postanalytics 2.16](../../../admin-en/installation-postanalytics-en/).
    * If the version `2.14.x` is installed, follow the instructions for the [WAF node 2.14](../../../2.14/admin-en/installation-kong-en/) and for [separate postanalytics packages 2.14](../../../2.14/admin-en/installation-postanalytics-en/) or update [WAF node packages](../../../updating-migrating/nginx-modules/) and [separate postanalytics packages](../../../updating-migrating/separate-postanalytics/) to the latest version in all installations.
    * If the version `2.12.x` or lower is installed, please update the [WAF node packages](../../../updating-migrating/nginx-modules/) and [separate postanalytics packages](../../../updating-migrating/separate-postanalytics/) to the latest version in all installations.

    More information about WAF node versioning is available in the [WAF node versioning policy](../updating-migrating/versioning-policy.md).

## 1. Add Wallarm Repositories

The filter node installs and updates from the Wallarm repositories.

Depending on your operating system, run one of the following commands:

--8<-- "../include/add-repo-kong-en-2.12.md"

--8<-- "../include/access-repo-en.md"

--8<-- "../include/issue-with-gpg-keys.md"

## 2. Install Wallarm Packages

To install the filter node and postanalytics on the same server, run the command:

--8<-- "../include/install-package-kong-en.md"

To install the filter node alone, run the command:

--8<-- "../include/install-package-primary-kong-en-2.12.md"

## 3. Configure Postanalytics 

!!! info
    Skip this step if you installed postanalytics on a separate server as you already have your postanalytics configured.

--8<-- "../include/configure-postanalytics-kong-en-2.12.md"

## 4. Set up the Filter Node for Using a Proxy Server

--8<-- "../include/setup-proxy.md"

## 5. Connect the Filter Node to the Wallarm Cloud

--8<-- "../include/connect-cloud-en.md"

## 6. Configure the Postanalytics Server Addresses

!!! info
    * Skip this step if you installed postanalytics and the filter node on the same server.
    * Do this step if you installed postanalytics and the filter node on separate servers.

--8<-- "../include/configure-postanalytics-address-kong-en.md"

## 7. Set up the Filtration Mode

--8<-- "../include/setup-filter-kong-en.md"

## 8. Configure Logging

--8<-- "../include/installation-step-logging.md"

## Start Kong

To start Kong with the installed Wallarm module, run the command:

```
