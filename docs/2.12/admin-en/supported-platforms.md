    Make sure that you acquire the following before installing the filter node:

    *   The supported platform 
    *   The permissions to execute commands with `root` rights
    *   A Wallarm account in one of the following clouds:

        *   [The Wallarm EU cloud][link-wallarm-account-eu]

    The integration of the filter node with NGINX or NGINX Plus is performed using several modules.
    
    There are [several options for module installation][link-doc-nginx-overview]. The option you select will depend on the way you install NGINX or NGINX Plus.
    
    Additionally, you can deploy a filter node as a Docker container. The resulting filter node installation will contain all necessary modules (see [installation instructions][link-ig-docker-nginx]).
    
    !!! info "Supported Operating Systems"
