# Configuration Options for the NGINX‑Based Filter Node

!!! info "NGINX official documentation"
    The Wallarm configuration is very similar to the NGINX configuration. [See the official NGINX documentation](https://www.nginx.com/resources/admin-guide/). Along with the Wallarm specific configuration options, you have the full capabilities of the NGINX configuration.

## Wallarm Directives

### wallarm_enable_libdetection

Enables additional validation of the SQL Injection attacks via the **libdetection** library. Using **libdetection** ensures the double‑detection of attacks and reduces the number of false positives.

Analyzing of requests with the **libdetection** library is disabled by default. To reduce the number of false positives, we recommend to enable analysis (`wallarm_enable_libdetection on`).

[More details on **libdetection** →](../about-wallarm-waf/protecting-against-attacks.md#library-libdetection)

To allow **libdetection** to analyze the request body, please ensure that buffering of a client request body is enabled ([`proxy_request_buffering on`](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_request_buffering)). 

!!! warning "Memory consumption increase"
    When analyzing attacks using the libdetection library, the amount of memory consumed by NGINX and Wallarm processes may increase by about 10%.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and location blocks.

    To enable libdetection in the Wallarm Ingresss controller, it is required to [apply](configure-kubernetes-en.md#enabling-attack-analysis-with-libdetection) the `nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/server-snippet` annotation with this parameter to the Ingress resource.

    Default value is `off`.

### wallarm_acl

Allows you to restrict access to resources when a request IP address is in the specified ACL (Access Control List). 

The specified ACL must be declared with the directive `wallarm_acl_db`.

You can use the `satisfy` directive to set constraints from both the ACL and other NGINX modules, such as ngx_http_access_module.

Setting directive to **off** disables the ACL check.

**Example:**

```
satisfy any;

wallarm_acl wapi;

allow 1.2.3.4/0;
deny all;
```

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and/or location blocks.

### wallarm_acl_api

If this directive is applied within the location block, then this location can be used to manage ACL content.

**Example:**
```
location / wallarm-acl {
  allow 127.0.0.1;
  deny all;

  wallarm_acl wapi;
  wallarm_acl_api on;
}
```

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and/or location blocks.

### wallarm_acl_db

Allows you to declare and configure an ACL database to restrict access by IP addresses.

**Example**

```
wallarm_acl_db wapi {
  wallarm_acl_path /var/cache/nginx/wallarm/acl/wapi;
}
```


!!! info
    The parameter can only be configured at the main level.


### wallarm_acl_mapsize

Allows you to set the initial memory size to be allocated for the corresponding ACL.

When the limit is reached, the memory will be automatically reallocated. However, the API request that attempted to change the ACL and caused the overflow, will produce an error and should be repeated.

!!! info
    The parameter can only be configured inside the `wallarm_acl_db` block.


### wallarm_acl_path

Specifies the directory that will be used to save the state of the ACL.

!!! info
    The parameter can only be configured inside the `wallarm_acl_db` block.

### wallarm_acl_block_page

Lets you set up the response code and the page returned to the client when the request was sent from a [blocked](../user-guides/blacklist.md) IP address. Directive value format: `wallarm_acl_block_page &/{path_to_file}/{html_htm_file_name} response_code={custom_code};`.

By default, the response code 403 and default NGINX block page are returned to the client. If you would like to customize the return to the client, you can set up the following configurations:

* Default Wallarm block page and a custom response code:

    ```bash
    wallarm_acl_block_page &/usr/share/nginx/html/wallarm_blocked.html response_code=445;
    ```

    To return default response code 403, you can omit `response_code=445`. 
* Custom block page and response code:

    ```bash
    # block page block.html located in /usr/share/nginx/html
    # response code 445
    wallarm_acl_block_page &/usr/share/nginx/html/block.html response_code=445;
    ```

    You can use [NGINX variables](https://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html) on the block page. For this, add the variable name in the format `${variable_name}` to the block page code. For example, `${remote_addr}` displays on the block page the IP address from which the blocked request was sent.

* Blocking message return or the block page and custom response code described in the `location` block:

    ```bash
    # response code 445 and the message "The page is blocked"
    wallarm_acl_block_page @block;
    location @block {
        return 445 'The page is blocked';
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    # response code 445 and the page 445.html located in /usr/share/nginx/html
    wallarm_acl_block_page /err445;     # /err445 – location to redirect the request to
    error_page 445 @blocked;        # The request that triggered the 445 error is passed to the @blocked location 
    location @blocked {
        root /var/www/errors;           # The directory with the 445.htm file
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /445.htm break;  # The redirect to the /445.htm
    }
    location = /err445 {
        internal;                   # The internal location that is not available from the outside
        return 445;                 # The 445 response code is returned
        }
    ```
    
!!! warning "Important Information for Debian and CentOS Users"
    If you use an NGINX version lower than 1.11 installed from [CentOS/Debian][doc-nginx-install] repositories, you should remove the `request_id` variable from the page code in order to display the dynamic blocking page correctly:
    ```
    UUID ${request_id}
    ```

    This applies to both `wallarm_blocked.html` and to the custom block page.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and location blocks.

### wallarm_api_conf

A path to the `node.yaml` file, which contains access requirements for the Wallarm API.

**Example**: 
```
wallarm_api_conf /etc/wallarm/node.yaml
```

Used to upload serialized requests from the filtering node directly to the Wallarm API (cloud) instead of uploading into the postanalytics module (Tarantool).
**Only requests with attacks are sent to the API.** Requests without attacks are not saved.

**Example of the node.yaml file content:**
``` bash
# API connection credentials

hostname: <some name>
uuid: <some uuid>
secret: <some secret>

# API connection parameters (the parameters below are used by default)

api:
  host: api.wallarm.com
  port: 444
  use_ssl: true
  ca_verify: true
```


### wallarm_block_page

Lets you set up the response code and page returned to the client when a malicious request has been blocked. Directive value format: `wallarm_block_page &/{path_to_file}/{html_htm_file_name} response_code={custom_code};`.

By default, the response code 403 and default NGINX block page are returned to the client. If you would like to customize the return to the client, you can set up the following configurations:

* Default Wallarm block page and a custom response code:

    ```bash
    wallarm_block_page &/usr/share/nginx/html/wallarm_blocked.html response_code=445;
    ```

    To return default response code 403, you can omit `response_code=445`. 
* Custom block page and response code:

    ```bash
    # block page block.html located in /usr/share/nginx/html
    # response code 445
    wallarm_block_page &/usr/share/nginx/html/block.html response_code=445;
    ```

    You can use [NGINX variables](https://nginx.org/en/docs/varindex.html) on the block page. For this, add the variable name in the format `${variable_name}` to the block page code. For example, `${remote_addr}` displays on the block page the IP address from which the blocked request was sent.

* Blocking message return or the block page and custom response code described in the `location` block:

    ```bash
    # response code 445 and the message "The page is blocked"
    wallarm_block_page @block;
    location @block {
        return 445 'The page is blocked';
    }
    ```

    ```bash
    # response code 445 and the page 445.html located in /usr/share/nginx/html
    wallarm_block_page /err445;     # /err445 – location to redirect the request to
    error_page 445 @blocked;        # The request that triggered the 445 error is passed to the @blocked location 
    location @blocked {
        root /var/www/errors;           # The directory with the 445.htm file
        rewrite ^(.*)$ /445.htm break;  # The redirect to the /445.htm
    }
    location = /err445 {
        internal;                   # The internal location that is not available from the outside
        return 445;                 # The 445 response code is returned
        }
    ```
    
!!! warning "Important Information for Debian and CentOS Users"
    If you use an NGINX version lower than 1.11 installed from [CentOS/Debian][doc-nginx-install] repositories, you should remove the `request_id` variable from the page code in order to display the dynamic blocking page correctly:
    ```
    UUID ${request_id}
    ```

    This applies to both `wallarm_blocked.html` and to the custom block page.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and location blocks.

### wallarm_cache_path

!!! info
    This parameter is configured inside the http block only.


### wallarm_fallback

With the value set to **on**, NGINX has the ability to enter an emergency mode; if proton.db or LOM cannot be downloaded, this setting disables the Wallarm module for the http, server, and location blocks, for which the data fails to download. NGINX keeps functioning.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and location blocks.


### wallarm_force

Sets the requests' analysis and LOM rules generation based on the NGINX mirrored traffic. See [Analyzing mirrored traffic with NGINX](mirror-traffic-en.md).

### wallarm_global_trainingset_path

* `s` for seconds,
* `ms` for milliseconds.

!!! info
    This parameter is configured only inside the http block.
    
    **Default value**: `1` (one minute)

### wallarm_instance

An application identifier. The directive is used to visually separate the data of different applications on the *Dashboard*. Numeric values only.

The application identifiers are used solely for the convenience of data presentation. To correctly separate the data of different applications, the same application identifiers must be set in the Wallarm interface.

Any filter node will filter traffic for any number of applications without additional configuration.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and location blocks.


### wallarm_key_path

A path to the Wallarm license key.

!!! info
    **Default value**: `/etc/wallarm/license.key`


### wallarm_local_trainingset_path

A path to the [LOM](../glossary-en.md#lom) file that contains information on the protected application and the filter node settings.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and location blocks.
    
    **Default value**: `/etc/wallarm/lom`


### wallarm_mode

Traffic processing mode:

- **off**: requests are not processed.
- **monitoring**: all requests are processed, but none of them are blocked even if an attack is detected.
- **block**: all requests where an attack was detected are blocked.

The value can include variables that are available after receiving a request string and headers. This can be used for applying various policies for various clients:

```
geo $wallarm_mode_real {
    default block;
    1.1.1.1/24 monitoring;
    2.2.2.2 off;
}
...

wallarm_mode $wallarm_mode_real;
```

You can see the detailed example of filtration mode configuration by proceeding to this [link](block-part-en.md).

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and location blocks.
    
    **Default value**: `off`

--8<-- "../include/scanner-whitelist-warning.md"

Usage of `wallarm_mode` can be restricted by the `wallarm_mode_allow_override` directive.


### wallarm_mode_allow_override

Manages the ability to override the `wallarm_mode` values via filtering rules downloaded from the Wallarm cloud (LOM):

- **off**: the rules set in LOM are ignored.
- **strict**: LOM can only strengthen the operation mode.
- **on**: it is possible to both strengthen and soften the operation mode.

For example, with `wallarm_mode monitoring` and `wallarm_mode_allow_override strict` set, the Wallarm cloud can be used to enable blocking of some requests, but the attack analysis cannot be fully disabled.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and location blocks.
    
    **Default value**: `on`


### wallarm_parse_response

The mode of processing web server responses; by default, only the client's request to the web server can be processed.

- **off**: responses are not analyzed.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside http, server, and location blocks.
    
    **Default value**: `on`

!!! warning "Improve performance"
    You are recommended to disable processing of static files through `location` to improve performance.

### wallarm_parse_websocket

Wallarm has full WebSockets support. By default, the WebSockets' messages are not analyzed for attacks. To force the feature, use the `wallarm_parse_websocket` directive.

Possible values:

With the `wallarm_tarantool_upstream`, you can balance the requests between several postanalytics servers.

**Example:**

```bash
upstream wallarm_tarantool {
    server 127.0.0.1:3313 max_fails=0 fail_timeout=0 max_conns=1;
    keepalive 1;
}

# omitted

wallarm_tarantool_upstream wallarm_tarantool;
```

See also [Module ngx_http_upstream_module](https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_upstream_module.html).

!!! warning "Required conditions"

    * The value of the `keepalive` parameter must not be lower than the number of the tarantool servers.
    * The value of the `max_conns` parameter must be specified for each of the upstream Tarantool servers to prevent the creation of excessive connections.

!!! info
    The parameter is configured inside the http block only.

### wallarm_timeslice

A limit on the time that a filter node spends on one iteration of processing a request before it switches to the next request. Upon reaching the time limit, the filter node proceeds to process the next request in the queue. After performing one iteration on each of the requests in the queue, the node performs the second iteration of processing on the first request in the queue.

You can use time intervals suffixes that are described in the [nginx documentation](https://nginx.org/en/docs/syntax.html) to assign different time unit values to the directive.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and location blocks.
    **Default value**: `0` (time limit for single iteration is disabled).

-----

!!! warning
    Due to NGINX server limitations, it is necessary to disable the buffering request by assigning the `off` value to the `proxy_request_buffering` NGINX directive for the `wallarm_timeslice` directive to work.

* `m` or `M` for megabytes
* `g` or `G` for gigabyte

Value of **0** turns the limit off.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http, server, and/or location blocks.
    
    **Default value**: `1` GB

### wallarm_unpack_response

If the backend sends compressed data, the value `on` decompresses the data before processing. The value `off` turns off the decompressing.

!!! info
    **Default value**: `on`.


### wallarm_upstream_backend

A method for sending serialized requests. Requests can be sent either to the Tarantool or to the API.

Possible values of the directive:
*   `tarantool`
*   `api`

Depending on the other directives, the default value will be assigned as follows:
*   `tarantool`—if there is no `wallarm_api_conf` directive in the configuration.
*   `api`—if there is a `wallarm_api_conf` directive, but there is no `wallarm_tarantool_upstream` directive in the configuration.

    !!! note
        If the `wallarm_api_conf` and `wallarm_tarantool_upstream` directives are present simultaneously in the configuration, a configuration error of the *directive ambiguous wallarm upstream backend* form will occur.

!!! info
    This parameter can be set inside the http block only.


### wallarm_upstream_connect_attempts

Defines the number of immediate reconnects to the Tarantool or Wallarm API.
If a connection to the Tarantool or API is terminated, then the attempt to reconnect will not occur. However, this is not the case when there aren't anymore connections and the serialized request queue is not empty.

!!! note
    Reconnection may occur through another server, because the “upstream” subsystem is responsible for choosing the server.
    
    This parameter can be set inside the http block only.
