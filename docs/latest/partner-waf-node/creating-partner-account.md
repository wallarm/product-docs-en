3. Send a request for switching your account to a partner status and for creating a [technical client account](overview.md#partner-account-components) to the [Wallarm technical support](mailto:support@wallarm.com). Send the following data with the request:
    * Name of the used Wallarm Cloud (EU Cloud or US Cloud)
    * Names for a partner account and technical client account
    * Email addresses of employees who should have access to the technical client account (after switching your account to a partner status, you will be able to add employees yourself)
    * Logo for branded Wallarm Console, emails and reports
    * Language for the Wallarm Console interface (English or Russian)
    * Custom domain for the Wallarm Console, certificate and encryption key for the domain
    * Your technical support email address

### Step 2: Access the partner account and get parameters for the WAF node configuration

After switching your account to partner status and creating a [technical client account](overview.md#partner-account-components), Wallarm technical support staff will:

* Add you to the list of users of the technical client account with the [role](../user-guides/settings/users.md) **Global administrator**.
* If you sent email adrresses of your employees, the Wallarm technical support will add employees to the list of users of the technical client account with the [role](../user-guides/settings/users.md) **Global read only**. Unregistered employees will receive emails with the link for setting a new password to access the technical client account.
* Send you the partner UUID. The credential will be used for linking clients.

## Providing employees with access to a technical client account

To manage partner WAF nodes with your team, you can provide your employees with access to the [technical client account](overview.md#partner-account-components). Employees can be added to the account with the following user roles:

* Regular roles provide access only to the technical client account
* Global roles provide access to the technical client account and to the accounts of all partner clients linked to the partner account
