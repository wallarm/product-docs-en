# Rules defining attack counters

## Rules overview

Rules **Define forced browsing attacks counter** and **Define brute-force attacks counter** are used to add tags to specific requests. The postanalytics module uses these tags to detect [dirbust (forced browsing)](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#forced-browsing) and [brute‑force](../../attacks-vulns-list.md#bruteforce-attack) attacks respectively.

!!! info "Applying the rule to real traffic"
    To apply the rule to real traffic, you need to set a threshold to trigger the rule:

     * Number of 404 responses for the rule **Define forced browsing attacks counter**
     * Number of requests for the rule **Define brute-force attacks counter**

     Thresholds are configured via triggers. Examples of triggers are available at this [link](../triggers/trigger-examples.md#mark-requests-as-a-bruteforce-or-dirbust-attack-if-31-or-more-requests-were-sent-to-the-protected-resource).

## Creating and applying the rule

To create and apply the rule:

1. Create the rule **Define forced browsing attacks counter** or **Define brute-force attacks counter** in the **Profile & Rules** section of the Wallarm Console. The rule consists of the following components:

    * **Condition** describes the request to add the brute‑force or forced browsing tags to.
    * **Counter name** defines the name of the tag which will be added to the request. The name should correspond to the following format:
        * `d:<name>` for the rule **Define forced browsing attacks counter**
        * `b:<name>` for the rule **Define brute-force attacks counter**

    !!! info "Message about inherited counter"
        If you have a **Default rule** defining attack counter, you can get a message `Inherited counter: <name>` when creating a rule with defined conditions that will trigger this rule. **Default rule** is applied to all incoming requests as it does not have defined conditions that triggger the rule.
        
        The message is for informational purposes only. Operation of the rule with defined trigger conditions will not be affected as it has a higher priority than the **Default rule**.
2. Create a trigger with a threshold for the rule to fire. Examples of triggers are available at this [link](../triggers/trigger-examples.md#mark-requests-as-a-bruteforce-or-dirbust-attack-if-31-or-more-requests-were-sent-to-the-protected-resource).

## Rule examples

* Add a forced browsing attack tag `d:api_fr_user_passwords` to requests sent to the path `api/frontend/user/passwords` of the protected resource
* Add a brute-force attack tag `b:api_fr_user_login` to requests sent to the path `api/frontend/user/login` of the protected resource
