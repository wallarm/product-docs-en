# Micro Focus ArcSight Logger via Fluentd

## Example overview

--8<-- "../include/integrations/webhook-examples/overview.md"

In the provided example, events are sent via webhooks to the Fluentd log collector and forwarded to the ArcSight Logger system.

!!! info "Integration with the Enterprise version of ArcSight ESM"
    To configure forwarding logs from Fluentd to the Enterprise version of ArcSight ESM, it is recommended to configure the Syslog Connector on the ArcSight side and then forward logs from Fluentd to the connector port. To get a more detailed description of the connectors, please download the **SmartConnector User Guide** from the [official ArcSight SmartConnector documentation](https://community.microfocus.com/t5/ArcSight-Connectors/ct-p/ConnectorsDocs).

## Used resources

* [ArcSight Logger 7.1](#arcsight-logger-configuration) with the WEB URL `https://192.168.1.73:443` installed on CentOS 7.8
* [Fluentd](#fluentd-configuration) installed on Debian 10.4 (Buster) and available on `https://192.168.1.65:9880`
* Administrator access to Wallarm Console in [EU cloud](https://my.wallarm.com) to [configure the webhook integration](#configuration-of-webhook-integration)

### ArcSight Logger configuration

ArcSight Logger has logs receiver `Wallarm Fluentd logs` configured as follows:

* Logs are received via UDP (`Type = UDP Receiver`)
* Listening port is `514`
* Events are parsed with the syslog parser
* Other default settings

To get a more detailed description of the receiver configuration, please download the **Logger Installation Guide** of an appropriate version from the [official ArcSight Logger documentation](https://community.microfocus.com/t5/Logger-Documentation/ct-p/LoggerDoc).

### Fluentd configuration

Fluentd is configured in the `td-agent.conf` file:

* Incoming webhook processing is configured in the `source` directive:
    * All HTTP and HTTPS traffic is sent to 9880 Fluentd port
    * TLS certificate for HTTPS connection is located within the file `/etc/pki/ca.pem`
* Forwarding logs to ArcSight Logger and log output are configured in the `match` directive:
    * All event logs are copied from Fluentd and forwarded to ArcSight Logger at the IP address `https://192.168.1.73:514`
    * Logs are forwarded from Fluentd to ArcSight Logger in the JSON format according to the [Syslog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog) standard
    * Connection with ArcSight Logger is established via UDP
    * Fluentd logs are additionally printed on the command line in JSON format (19-22 code lines). The setting is used to verify that events are logged via Fluentd

```bash linenums="1"
<source>
  @type http # input plugin for HTTP and HTTPS traffic
  port 9880 # port for incoming requests
  <transport tls> # certificates for HTTPS connection
    ca_path /etc/pki/ca.pem
  </transport>
</source>
<match **>
  @type copy
  <store>
      @type remote_syslog # output plugin to forward logs from Fluentd via Syslog
      host 192.168.1.73 # IP address to forward logs to
      port 514 # port to forward logs to
      protocol udp # connection protocol
    <format>
      @type json # format of forwarded logs
    </format>
  </store>
  <store>
     @type stdout # output plugin to print Fluentd logs on the command line
     output_type json # format of logs printed on the command line
  </store>
</match>
```

A more detailed description of configuration files is available in the [official Fluentd documentation](https://docs.fluentd.org/configuration/config-file).

!!! info "Testing Fluentd configuration"
    To check that Fluentd logs are created and forwarded to ArcSight Logger, the PUT or POST request can be sent to Fluentd.

    **Request example:**
    ```curl
    curl -X POST 'https://192.168.1.65:9880' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"key1":"value1", "key2":"value2"}'
    ```
