# Regular WAF nodes

The regular WAF node is used in Linux‑based, Kubernetes sidecar and Docker‑based deployments.

## Creating WAF node

The regular WAF node is created while setting up integration with the platform:

* [NGINX](../../waf-installation/nginx/dynamic-module.md)
* [NGINX Plus](../..//waf-installation/nginx-plus.md)
* [Docker](../../admin-en/installation-docker-en.md)
* [Kubernetes sidecar container](../../admin-en/installation-guides/kubernetes/wallarm-sidecar-container.md)
* [Kong](../../admin-en/installation-kong-en.md)

If the integration is successfully finished, then the created WAF node will be displayed in the list of nodes in Wallarm UI.

## Viewing details of WAF node

The details of the installed WAF node are displayed in the table and card of each WAF node. To open the card, click the appropriate table record.

The following node properties and metrics are available:

* Node name that was given to the node upon creation
* The average number of requests per second (RPS)
* Node IP address
* Unique node identifier (UUID)
* Time of the last synchronization of the WAF node and Wallarm cloud
* Date of the WAF node creation
* Number of requests processed by the node in the current month
* Versions of used LOM and proton.db
* Versions of installed Wallarm WAF packages, NGINX, and Envoy (if any)
* Indicator of available component updates
