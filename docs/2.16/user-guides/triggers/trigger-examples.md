## Blacklist IP if 4 or more attack vectors were detected in 3 hours (default trigger)

The trigger **Block IPs with high count of attack vectors** is created for all clients by default. If 4 or more different attack vectors were sent to the protected resource from one IP address, this IP address will be blacklisted for 1 hour.
