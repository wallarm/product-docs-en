# Creating Triggers

Triggers are configured in your Wallarm account > the **Triggers** section. Only users with the **Administrator** [role](../settings/users.md) can access this section.

![!Section to configure triggers](../../images/user-guides/triggers/create-trigger.png)

1. Click the **Create a new trigger** button.
2. [Choose](#step-1-choosing-a-condition) conditions.
3. [Add](#step-2-adding-filters) filters.
4. [Add](#step-3-adding-reactions) reactions.
5. [Save](#step-4-saving-the-trigger) the trigger.

## Step 1: Choosing a Condition

A condition is a system event to be notified about. The following conditions are available for notification:

* Number of requests
* Number of attack vectors
* Number of attacks
* Number of hits
* Number of incidents
* Blacklisted IP
* User added

Choose a condition in your Wallarm account interface and set the lower threshold for the reaction, if the setting is available.

## Step 2: Adding Filters

Filters are used for condition detailing. For example, you can set up reactions to attacks of certain types, such as brute-force attacks, SQL injections and others.

The following filters are available:

* **Type** is a [type](../../attacks-vulns-list.md) of attack detected in the request or a type of vulnerability the request is directed to.
* **Application** is the [application](../settings/applications.md) that receives the request or in which an incident is detected.
* **IP** is the IP address from which the request is sent.
* **Domain** is the domain that receives the request or in which an incident is detected.
* **Response status** is the response code returned to the request.
* **Target** is an application architecture part that the attack is directed at or in which the incident is detected. It can take the following values: `Server`, `Client`, `Database`.
* **User's role** is the role of the added user. It can take the following values: `Deploy`, `Analyst`, `Admin`.

Choose one or more filters in your Wallarm account interface and set values for them.

## Step 3: Adding Reactions

A reaction is an action that should be performed if the specified condition and filters are met. Reactions are divided into the **Notifications** and **Event management** groups. The tools in groups are configured as [integrations](../settings/integrations/integrations-intro.md). You can select one or more integrations from this list:
* Email
* Slack
* Telegram
* OpsGenie
* InsightConnect
* PagerDuty
* Splunk
* Sumo Logic
* Webhook

To add a reaction:
1. Set up integrations with email, messengers and incident management or SIEM systems as described in these [instructions](../settings/integrations/integrations-intro.md). To use an already existing integration, skip this step.
2. Choose the configured integration in the trigger creation modal window.

## Step 4: Saving the Trigger

1. Click the **Create** button in the trigger creation modal window.
2. Specify the trigger's name and description (if required) and click the **Done** button.

The saved trigger will be displayed in the trigger list in your Wallarm account.
